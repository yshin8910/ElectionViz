## Startup

To start up the python web server that hosts the projects files, use the following command:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

If this command file does not work, please open this file using Visual Studio Code and start up the “Go Live” feature, which is an extension that can be added called “Live Server”.
