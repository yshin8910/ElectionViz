            The Great Recession and the 2008 Presidential Election
          </h1>
          <p>
            Home ownership had been expanding in the early 2000s and a housing
            boom was inevitable thanks to the Bush administrations legislature
            that allowed Americans to secure a low-interest federal loan to help
            in buying a house. This quickly back-fired as many Americans started
            to buy a house using loans that they couldn't afford to pay back.
            This led to what is known as the Great Recession in the United
            States. See

          <h1 class="title">How the Recession Impacted the 2008 Election</h1>
          <p>
            During George W. Bush’s presidency, America fell into the Great
            Recession, the longest period of economic decline since the Great
            Depression in the 1930s. People were losing their jobs, savings, and
            homes while major banks were going bankrupt one after another.
            <br /><br />President Bush and the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the
            target interest rate, at one point to zero, and sent stimulus
            packages to encourage spending and get the economy up again, but the
            recession was already too deep in troubles for these actions to make
            a big impact. This recession caused a shift between voters of the
            two parties in America.<br /><br />

            The choropleth map on the right displays the percentage change in
            the number of votes for the democratic and republican party in each
            state and county for the 2004 and 2008 general elections.
            <br /><br />
            You can interact with the map by hovering over each state to see
            summary statistics about the data. Additionally, you can click on
            any state to zoom in and see the county-level data with the same
            hovering functionality. <br /><br />
            A legend for the colors is display below. High blue coloring
            indicates a high change in democratic vote and a low change in
            republican vote from 2004 to 2008. Similarly, a high red coloring
            indicates a high change in republican vote and a low change in
            democratic vote. States which are colored maroon had a high change
            in both democratic and republican votes. Finally, a light coloring
            indicates a low change in the vote for both parties.

          <h2 class="title">Republican Voters Shift to the Democratic Party</h2>
          During the 2004 Presidential Election, the vote difference between
          presidential candidates George W. Bush and John F. Kerry was fairly
          even with Bush receiving 286 electoral votes and 62,040,610 popular
          votes and Kerry receiving 251 electoral votes and 59,028,444 popular
          votes.
          <br /><br />
          In the 2008 presedential election, Barack Obama was able to capture
          the vote of many that were once a part of the Republican party. For
          example, it can be seen from the map that the Democratic party saw a
          15.9% vote increase in Michigan from 2004 while the Republican party
          had a 11.5% vote decrease from 2004. Overall, Obama won the 2008
          election with 39% Democrat voters and 32% Republican voters.
          <br /><br />
          The response to the Great Recession from President Bush and the
          Republican party was a likely cause for many Republicans to vote for
          Obama instead of McCain because President Bush’s interventions by
          providing the stimulus package and lowering the target interest rate
          did not make a large impact on helping the economy and the American
          people.<br /><br />

            This map shows the unemployment rate for each county in Michigan.
            You can interact with the map by hovering over a county to see
            summary statistics about the unemployment rate and the outcome of
            the 2008 election in that county.<br /><br />
            During the Great Recession, Michigan was impacted more than other
            states because not only was it impacted by the general subprime
            mortgage crisis, where home loans were granted to those with poor
            credit history, but also it’s economy. Eventually, the bankruptcy of
            the automotive companies based in Michigan such as GM and Chrysler
            caused additional damage to Michigan's economy. <br /><br />
            Michigan reached its peak unemployment rate of 10%, and compared to
            other states, the majority of the counties had a 9-10% unemployment
            rate. The majority of these counties saw a high turnout for Obama in
            the 2008 election.<br /><br />

            One of the key swing states that favored Obama in 2008 was Florida.
            Florida also happened to be another one of the states which was hit
            hardest by the Great Recession. In particular, the areas hit hardest
            are in the southern regions of the state such as Palm Beach County
            and Hendry County which had high unemployment rates in 2008. Obama
            was able to campaign on the economic and employment hardships that
            the people of Florida were facing because of the recession and the
            turnout in population-dense counties which saw high unemployment
            favored Obama over McCain.

            This chart is plotting the voting rate of certain demographics in
            the United States over time. You can also filter some of the data
            points by toggling the line on or off by clicking on the
            corresponding checkbox at the top.
            <br /><br />
            While unemployment and overall economic health was a large factor
            which contributed to the voting shift in 2008, there was an entire
            voting demographic which saw an incredible surge in 2008. As seen
            from this chart, the African American vote was on a steady upwards
            trend prior to the 2008 election but saw a surge in the 2008
            election. These voters turned out overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008
            helping contribute to his decisive victory over John McCain. Find
